# Lift Simulation

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Lift Simulation project! This web application simulates a building with multiple floors and lifts. Users can input the number of floors and lifts, and an interactive UI will be generated with visual depictions of lifts and buttons on floors. The lifts respond to user commands, moving to the specified floors upon button clicks.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1:

- **Data Store:** Implemented a data store to maintain the state of the application data.

- **JS Engine:** Developed a JavaScript engine that acts as the controller, determining which lift goes to which floor.

- **Dumb UI:** Created a basic user interface that responds to the commands from the controller.

### Milestone 2:

- **Lift Animation:** Implemented lift door animation, opening in 2.5 seconds and closing in another 2.5 seconds.

- **Lift Movement:** Set the lift's movement speed at 2 seconds per floor, ensuring it stops at every floor where it was called.

- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Designed the user interface to be responsive and mobile-friendly.
